"Dear Madam or Sir,
 
 I will be enrolling as a student at MTEC starting this September. For the
 past four years, I have been at ETH with the current email address under
 different positions. I would like to register for my new program, however the
 password does not work in my studies, nor am I able to change it at
 password.ethz.ch. Perhaps, it is because I am already in the system with the
 same user name.
 
 Could you please help me so that I am able to register for the MTEC MAS
 program under my studies? Also, would it be possible to have this under my
 current user name and password, and also to be able to retain my erdw email
 address? I am currently using this for teaching, course coordinating and
 publications.
 
 Thank you for your assistance.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Nathalie Lefebvre
 
 Dear Mr. Friederich,
 
 Thank you for getting back to me. Could you please mail my new password. The
 information you requested is as follows:
 1. March 8, 1975
 2. Hirtenhofstrasse 40A, 6005-Luzern
 
 Would it be possible to register for MTEC with my existing ETH username and
 password? When I tried this, there were not programs that I could register for
 in MyStudies. Would it be possible to merge my current information and that of
 the MTEC program? Also, would it be possible to keep my current email address?
 As I mentioned, I use this for teaching, course coordinating and publications
 for ETH.
 
 Thanks again for your help.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Nathalie"
